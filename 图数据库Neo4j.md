		"text": "\n  There are many films about our Lord and Savior out there, and they usually offer something different.The 1977 \"Jesus of Nazareth\" offers a harmonious composition of the 4 Gospels as well as educated speculation. You need 6 1/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.Mr. Gibson's \"The Passion\" (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)This is a great version if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense \"The Passion.\"This film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the \"Gospel According to Luke.\"  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.Alright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.I'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read \"Luke,\" you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.The sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in \"The Passion.\" But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.Like I said, if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,\" this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.Another thing I should point out is that \"The Passion\" is NOT child friendly. \"Jesus of Nazareth\" is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of \"The Passion.\" But 6 1/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from \"Luke.\" And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in \"The Passion.\"Another thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written \"Good News Bible.\"I like \"Jesus of Nazareth\" and \"The Passion.\" And I can suggest this film as well without reservation.\n",

		"summary": "The Best Jesus version for me",
		"text": "\n  Didn't know Brian  Deacon. Now I am a fan. My siblings and I grew up agreeing with Jesus of Nazareth as our favorite Jesus movie, esp because Robert Powell was the closest to how we think Jesus could've been like. His scrawny body would be how Jesus might've looked like from the physical mental spiritual exercises he had to go through. Robert Powell's soulful eyes and his acting was good. This movie on the other hand came off as a retro-ish 70's 80's kinda because of the hairstyle and the sound, and the accent was distinctly something else, but this surprisingly turned out to be REALLY good. The Jesus here is more spontaneous in his actions. He laughs. When he speaks, he teaches, it's like effortless. Yet the words are powerful. You could imagine Jesus. There are so many scenes and scripts in this movie that impressed on me. I have heard them before but hearing it the way the apostle had written (forgot which apostle, and I had lent this dvd to a new friend and hadn't gotten in back in a while so I had forgotten. AT the beginning of this movie it will tell you which apostle and now I too am a fan of his, too bad I had forgotten which one he was. :-)  made the story and the words have power again. Those who haven't seen this movie, I recommend it and you would know what I cannot describe. There is even a version for children which I didn't buy so I can't write my opinion about it. I love the scene with the children, and the one wherein the pharisees tried to trick him. And that before entering Jerusalem, many more. You have seen and heard them before but it's just different, powerful in its simple delivery. The scene where he was teaching in the forest and one follower asked something; oh, and that of the woman who had put coins for tithes, moving, many others in this movie. I have so many favorite scenes and verses from this film.Oh, and btw, this can be played in different languages. That new friend i had mentioned is  married to a Japanese who is not Christian and the couple was able to watch this together and the friend said he liked it and his wife did, too.Seller pay me for my endorsement! :-))\n",

Someone who was \"real\" who \"laughed\" \"cried\", got \"angry\", set an example without making others feel inferior. Doing unto others as He would have them do unto Him. I recommend this highly for family, groups, sleep overs for kids, and home groups for adults. And for those times when you need to eat ice cream/chocolate and be encouraged. (that's a \"she\" thing) LOL.\n",
